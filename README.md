Remote Connection Sorter (Eclipse)  
=============================

This is a Windows Powershell script that sorts remote connections for Eclipse IDE.

Setup
======
1. Find your Eclipse workspace.
2. Create a backup of your workspace (Just in case something weird happens).
3. Traverse to [WORKSPACE PATH]/.metadata/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.rse.core/profiles (You may need to enable hidden files)
4. Place the "sortFTP.ps1" into the profiles folder. You will notice a folder in here that will be similar to "PRF.kylesgg-pc_539". Take note of this folder name as you will need it later.
5. Open the script in a text editor of your choice. Set the "eclipse" variable (line 20) to the full path of your Eclipse executable. Set the "profile" variable to the name of that folder in step #4.
6. Run Windows Powershell as administrator. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" into Powershell and run the command. This will allow you to run Powershell scripts that you create, but it will only run scripts from the internet if  those scripts have been signed by a trusted publisher. More information on this can be found here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176949.aspx
7. Create a shortcut on your desktop and set the location of the item to the "sortFTP.ps1" you setup earlier.
8. Edit the shortcut you just created and set the target to:

powershell.exe -command "& 'E:\Web Workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.rse.core\sortFTP.ps1'"

Replace the path above with the path to your Powershell script.
9. Replace your normal Eclipse shortcut with your new shortcut. It will now sort your remote connections every time Eclipse is launched.

Enjoy!
